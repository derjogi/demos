# DEMOS

This project comes out of the desire to create an online deliberation & voting system coupled with it's own economic incentives tokens.

It is only meant to be a rough prototype to showcase what I'm envisioning; creating the whole project by myself would take me multiple years, 
and it is not always easy to explain this project in words, so a simple prototype seemed the best solution going forward.

I have however now found some possible other adjacent projects that I might investigate first.
Mainly [`decidim`](https://decidim.org), which looks like the most promising so far, but possibly also some new endeavours such as flowback.

So this project will probably stall after just a few hours of development, but well, better to cut losses early ;-) 

If by any chance anyone is ever reading this, I'm _very_ likely still interested in this space and active somewhere. 
If you are as well (interested in this) feel free to hit me up :-) 



## About setting up this project:
## create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
